# DotFiles
A repo to store any important dotfiles

To get vimrc working you need to install Vundle. To do this just follow the steps below.

1. Type in terminal "git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim"
2. Type in terminal "vim +PluginInstall +qall" to install all of the plugins mentioned in the vimrc

You should be good to go after that with the Vundle plugin manager installed as well as the plugins. For future reference on using Vundle in case you aren't familiar, just check out the github page in the link below.

I also made some useful shortcuts in my vimrc file. Ctrl-n will toggle the NERDTree view for your current directory. Ctrl-h and Ctrl-l will move left and right between vim tabs respectively.

# DotFiles
A repo to store any important dotfiles

To get vimrc working you need to install Vim Plug. The instructions to install can be found at the offical repository.

https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

After Installation run "nvim +PlugInstall +qall" to install dependencies

If you are using neovim then you should also install pynvim with pip3 to get
deoplete working

You MUST be using a terminal with true color support for my color settings
to display properly
